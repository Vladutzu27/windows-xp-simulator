# windows-xp-simulator
An old project I made in stagescript when I was 11. I needed to make it in a week, and I was preety happy with the results. Logiscool made projects shareable for 
fake internet points, so I added music to winamp and shared it.
I dont know If it is playable as of today, but ill try to provide a link.
WHEN THE PROGRAM ”BLUESCREENS” it doesnt acctually have any error. Its just a FEATURE. Press enter to select ”boot the last good configuration” and type ”win” in the DOS
